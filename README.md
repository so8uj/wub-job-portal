# About Us
The Local Job Portal is a university project designed to bridge the gap between small businesses and local job seekers. Our goal is to create a seamless and efficient platform where small enterprises can post job opportunities, and individuals can find employment that matches their skills and interests.

# Project Objective
This project aims to demonstrate the application of web development and database management in real-world scenarios. It focuses on building an intuitive and user-friendly job portal, integrating core functionalities such as job postings, applicant tracking, and employer-employee interaction.

# Why This Project?
Small businesses often struggle to find the right candidates due to a lack of resources and exposure. This platform serves as a cost-effective and efficient solution, empowering local businesses by providing them access to a talent pool within their community.
